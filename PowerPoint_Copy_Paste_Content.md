## SLIDE 2: PROBLEM STATEMENT

### Slide Title
```
🔴 THE PROBLEM: 3 Critical Challenges
```

### Content Sections:

#### Section 1: VOLUME OVERLOAD
```
📞 Managing 10,000+ daily customer messages manually
📞 Requires 20+ support agents per company
📞 Response time: 4-48 hours (vs. instant needed)
📞 Annual cost: ₹50-100L per mid-size company
```

#### Section 2: SILOED DATA
```
📊 Delivery, revenue, product data in separate systems
📊 No unified view for real-time decisions
📊 Real-time insights impossible
📊 Missed opportunities: restocking, routing, upselling
```

#### Section 3: REACTIVE, NOT PROACTIVE
```
⏰ Teams respond after customers complain
⏰ ~40% of issues preventable with proactive alerts
⏰ Revenue loss from delays: ₹10-50L per incident
⏰ Poor customer retention due to late responses
```

### Bottom Stat
```
📈 Market Impact: $8 BILLION lost annually by e-commerce
   (This is the problem we solve)
```

### Design Notes:
- Use icons (📞, 📊, ⏰, 📈)
- Left-align bullets
- Color-code each section (red, orange, yellow)
- 24pt+ font for readability

```
1. Customer Input (Chat / API Webhook)
         ↓
2. Intent Classification (NLP Layer)
         ↓
3. Agent Orchestrator (Multi-Agent Coordination)
         ↓
4. Three Specialized Agents:
   • Chat Agent (CRM, FAQ, Routing)
   • Delivery Agent (Tracking, Status, ETA)
   • Revenue Agent (Analytics, Trends, Top Products)
         ↓
5. PostgreSQL Database (Single Source of Truth)
         ↓
6. Response + Proactive Alerts
   (Chat, Dashboard, Email, Notifications)
```

### Right Column - Tech Stack

```
BACKEND:
• FastAPI (Python)
• Why: Excellent async, NLP integration, REST APIs

DATABASE:
• PostgreSQL + Redis
• Why: ACID compliance, time-series support, caching

FRONTEND:

## SLIDE 8: DEMO PREVIEW

### Slide Title
```
🎬 DEMO PREVIEW: 3 Key Scenarios
```

### Scenario 1: BASIC CUSTOMER QUERY (Autonomy)

```
SCENARIO 1: Customer Inquiry

Customer Asks:
  "Where's my order #12345?"

System Does:
  1. Classifies intent → ORDER_TRACKING
  2. Extracts entity → order_id = 12345
  3. Queries database → Fetches status
  4. Generates response → Natural language

System Responds:
  "Your order is in transit, ETA: tomorrow at 2 PM. 
   Click here for live tracking."

Result: ✅ INSTANT RESPONSE (not 24-hour wait)
```

### Scenario 2: BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE QUERY (Integration)

```
SCENARIO 2: Manager Query

Manager Asks:
  "What products sold best this week?"

System Does:
  1. Classifies intent → ANALYTICS
  2. Queries revenue database
  3. Aggregates by product + category
  4. Generates visualization

System Responds:
  "Top 5 Products This Week:
   1. Product A - ₹50,000
   2. Product B - ₹45,000
   3. Product C - ₹40,000
   [Live chart visualization]"

Result: ✅ REAL-TIME INSIGHTS (not daily reports)
```

### Scenario 3: PROACTIVE ALERT ⭐ (DIFFERENTIATOR!)

```
SCENARIO 3: Autonomous Proactivity

Trigger:
  [NO USER INPUT NEEDED]

System Detects:
  • Delivery for Order #XYZ is 3+ hours delayed
  • Delay exceeds 2-hour threshold
  • Anomaly detected in data stream

System Takes Action:
  1. Sends SMS/Email to customer
  2. Updates manager dashboard
  3. Logs decision for audit trail
  4. Suggests remediation (reroute, refund offer)

Result: ✅ ISSUE RESOLVED BEFORE CUSTOMER COMPLAINS
        ✅ SHOWS TRUE AUTONOMY (not reactive)
        ✅ DIFFERENTIATES FROM COMPETITORS
```

### Design Notes:
- Use boxes/cards for each scenario
- Bold customer/system queries
- Show input → process → output flow
- Highlight Scenario 3 in green/bright color (your differentiator!)
- Add emojis for visual interest

## SLIDE 11: RISKS & MITIGATIONS

### Slide Title
```
⚠️ RISKS & CONTINGENCY PLANS
Prepared for Everything
```

### Risk 1: LLM API QUOTA EXCEEDED

```
RISK:
  OpenAI free tier quota exhausted during development
  (API calls cost money, limited monthly budget)

LIKELIHOOD: Medium

MITIGATION STRATEGY:
  ✓ Monitor API usage daily
  ✓ Use Hugging Face free tier as primary fallback
  ✓ Implement rule-based intent classifier backup
  ✓ Batch API calls efficiently

STATUS: ✅ MANAGEABLE
```

### Risk 2: SCOPE CREEP

```
RISK:
  Team adds too many features, runs out of time
  (Common hackathon pitfall)

LIKELIHOOD: Medium

MITIGATION STRATEGY:
  ✓ Lock MVP scope at 3 agents (Hour 24)
  ✓ No new features after Hour 36
  ✓ Cut non-essential features first (email, SMS, mobile)
  ✓ Focus on 5-7 core demo scenarios

STATUS: ✅ CONTROLLABLE
```

### Risk 3: DEMO CRASHES DURING JUDGING

```
RISK:
  Live demo fails = scoring penalty
  (Network issues, LLM timeout, database error)

LIKELIHOOD: Low-Medium

MITIGATION STRATEGY:
  ✓ Test demo on actual presentation laptop
  ✓ Record video backup (4-5 min)
  ✓ Practice 5+ times before submission
  ✓ Offline mode with mock data ready
  ✓ Instant switch to video if needed

STATUS: ✅ PREPARED
```

### Risk 4: TEAM MEMBER UNAVAILABLE

```
RISK:
  Someone gets sick or can't participate
  (Life happens!)

LIKELIHOOD: Low

MITIGATION STRATEGY:
  ✓ Cross-train all members on core functionality
  ✓ Pre-distribute tasks and responsibilities
  ✓ Clear documentation of each module
  ✓ Weekly knowledge transfer sessions

STATUS: ✅ COVERED
```

### Bottom Statement
```
✓ CONCLUSION:
  All risks are manageable with prepared contingencies.
  Team has backup plans for every critical scenario.
  Judges respect teams that think ahead.
```

### Design Notes:
- 4 risk boxes stacked
- Use red/orange for risk label
- Use green/yellow for mitigation
- Include likelihood indicator
- Clear action items for each mitigation
- Status indicator (✅) at bottom of each
